<p>MemTest is a RAM reliability tester. A correctly functioning computer should
be able to store data in RAM with 100% accuracy day in and day out. A computer that
fails these tests,
perhaps because of old hardware, damaged hardware, or poorly configured
hardware, will be less stable and crash more often. Even worse, it will become even less
stable over time as corrupted data is written to your hard disk.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By running MemTest you can ensure that your computer's RAM is functioning correctly. This is a good thing to check whenever you buy a new computer, install new
RAM, or change the configuration of your machine (for instance, to overclock
it).&nbsp; If you are the sort of user who likes to push the performance of your
machine to the edge, relying upon whether your machine will boot after your new
BIOS tweaks is a poor way to determine the safety of your new settings. Use MemTest as a true test of stability.</p>

<p>Please read this section before contacting technical support.&nbsp; There are
some brief guidelines at the end for typical testing procedures, and comments on
typical results.</p>
<p>Unlike other memory checking software, MemTest is designed to find all types
of memory errors including intermittent problems. Therefore, it needs to be run
for several hours to fully evaluate your RAM. The best way to use the
system is to set it up to run overnight, for a fully rigorous test.&nbsp;
Letting MemTest run long enough to achieve 100% coverage will only identify RAM that
frequently corrupts all data written to it.&nbsp;You can also run
MemTest while you use your computer for other tasks, which will help identify
memory errors which only show up while the computer is under load.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To keep the test running smoothly and quickly, you should only test the
amount of RAM that is free, rather than the total amount of RAM in your system -
otherwise your computer will spend 90% of the test reading and writing to your
hard drive, rather than testing RAM. You can use the Windows2000/XP/Vista Task
Manager, or the Windows 9X System Monitor to determine the proper amount of ram
to check.&nbsp; As a rule of thumb, Win9X uses about 32MB of RAM when nothing is
open, and Windows2000/XP uses about 64MB.&nbsp; Even though you cannot directly
check this RAM, Windows dynamically moves the location of most of its subsystems,
so most of your RAM will be checked eventually.&nbsp;</p>
<p>No Windows program can directly check the RAM used by the OS; this is a fundamental
limitation of using a modern OS. If you need to check every byte, consider
purchasing MemTest Deluxe, which boots off its own floppy (or CD) for unfettered access
to RAM.&nbsp;</p>
<p>100% coverage represents one complete pass of testing your memory. In general,
running multiple passes is better. Here are three typical lengths
of testing you might try:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Test until 100% coverage (a quick test to make sure your RAM is
    functioning reasonably)</li>
  <li>Test for 1 hour (this will catch virtually all errors in your memory)</li>
  <li>Test overnight (your computer's not doing anything else at night anyway,
    why not be absolutely sure your RAM is good?)</li>
</ol>
<p> MemTest will report any errors that it finds as soon as it finds
them, so if you do not see any error messages then all testing so far has been
successful. Once you start testing, MemTest will continue to test
your RAM until you tell it to stop, or quit. The tests can run as long as you
wish, and become more rigorous the longer you let them go.&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>How it works:</b> MemTest tests the ability of your RAM to store many different unique bit patterns, and the ability
to correctly hold those values over various periods of time. More traditional memory checking programs can only
catch problems which show up immediately. MemTest catches both immediate errors
and long term errors. &nbsp;The longer you run the program, the better the test against
long term errors.&nbsp; If you can run MemTest overnight without errors this
means that your machine can function for that period of time without making a
single memory error, even when the RAM load is very heavy. Statistically, it also means that your machine is always able
to function without memory error.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><b>NOTE</b>: If you run MemTest and
it only checks a few % of RAM over the period of an hour, this means you told it
to allocate more RAM than is available. When this happens,
almost all of the testing time is taken reading from the hard disk swap, which
is a reasonable hard disk check, but not very useful for checking RAM. Select
less RAM to check and try again.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>In all cases, if MemTest finds an error it will stop and report it to you.
If you do get an error, you should consider replacing you RAM or at the very
least verifying that your machine is correctly configured. Note that even ONE
error is a sign of a serious problem - a correctly functioning computer can run
MemTest for weeks with no errors.&nbsp;</p>
<p> Unfortunately, due to variations in
motherboards and chipsets, it is impossible to reliably locate the physical chip that is
failing purely via software. It is still possible, however, to determine which
DIMM is failing if you have more than one, by elimination: Run the machine with one memory board installed
at a time; when errors are found the installed board is at fault.&nbsp;This is
also a good diagnostic for another reason: sometimes the problem is really with
the motherboard, and it will disappear if you have less RAM installed, or if the
DIMMs are installed in different slots.&nbsp;If you have access to multiple
computers, you can also try testing the &quot;faulty&quot; RAM in both to
isolate whether the problem is the memory or some other component.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have more than one memory board and you find errors with both, even
when you test them one at a time, this suggests that your RAM is probably OK.
Either your motherboard is failing, you are using memory timing settings that
are too aggressive, or your RAM is not compatible with your motherboard. You can
experiment with memory timing settings in your BIOS, which may allow you to use
your ram without errors at a small performance cost. Please refer to your
motherboard manual for information on this topic - HCI Design cannot provide
specific recommendations for BIOS settings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another potential cause of memory problems is overheating - make sure your
machine is well ventilated and try running the test again.</p>

<p>The normal version of MemTest is a Windows program, and is free for all users.&nbsp; There
are also <b>three</b> other versions available:</p>
<p><b>The Pro</b> version ($5) is a Windows program that extends the free
version.&nbsp; It is tuned to the needs of users who diagnose the quality of RAM
often, or on
multiple machines.&nbsp;Features include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>a &quot;nice&quot; mode which
allows you to test RAM in the background, during normal use of the machine&nbsp;.</li>
  <li>more detailed reporting of errors.</li>
  <li>It does not pause every time an
error is found, so it can be used to determine the overall reliability of RAM that is prone to errors, rather than just as a tool that determines if there are
any errors at all.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Errors are logged to disk so that you can send an official error report to
    whomever you bought the RAM from. Also, if the machine crashes or is shut
    down you can read the log to see what happened.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
  <li>It can be run without the &quot;first time
user&quot; messages.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p><b>The Deluxe floppy package</b> ($12) includes the Windows native Pro version. It adds an embedded
version of MemTest that runs from a bootable diskette. This version can be run
on any PC with a floppy drive and does not require any sort of installation. Use
it to check the RAM quality of any PC, whether it has Linux, Windows, or no OS
at all.&nbsp; Plus, since it does not load an OS, it can directly access and
test all of your RAM. This is a great disk for any computer technician to carry
around.&nbsp;It also uses the speed that memory is checked as a basic benchmark
of computer speed. This can be useful if you are testing different BIOS
settings. Not only will MemTest tell you if you RAM is still stable, but it will
also indicate if the tweaks you have made improve RAM performance.</p>
<p><b>The Deluxe CD package</b> ($14) includes the exact same software as the
floppy package, but comes on a bootable CDROM. This is useful if you don't have
a floppy disk drive in your computer.&nbsp;</p>
