**************************************

The latest release notes, source, and DSM files are available here:

http://home.comcast.net/~msrc4plugin

Version 1.2.2 - 8/16/2006

	* Removed SALTing of the key.  SALT broke Windows 2000 compatibility
	* Removed REG version of the plugin.  There is no good reason left to no use NOREG.

Version 1.2.1 - 7/10/2006

    * Fixed Windows 2000 encryption problem
    * Fixed missing password problem.

Version 1.2.0 - 5/17/2006

    * Further config window tweaks. Added enhanced search for the key file.
    * Adjusted the size of the config dialog to fit better in 640X480.
    * Fixed some problems with reverse connections.
    * Plugin can be used with or without a key file. If no key file is found the plugin uses a hashed version of the VNC password.
    * Added SALTing of the key for each session. This makes each session key unique. This also makes it incompatible with all earlier plugins. Key files are still valid.
